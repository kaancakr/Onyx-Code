# Onyx Code

**Onyx Code** is a mobile application designed to help users learn programming and algorithm techniques through an interactive question-answer model. The app offers a structured learning path, making it easier for users to grasp complex concepts in programming and algorithms.

## Features

- **Question-Answer Model**: Learn by answering questions, with immediate feedback on correctness.
- **Programming Techniques**: Covers a wide range of programming techniques, from basic to advanced levels.
- **Algorithm Learning**: Focused sections on understanding and implementing algorithms.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep track of your learning progress and improve over time.
- **Firebase Integration**: Secure authentication and real-time database for storing user data and progress.
- **Swift and SwiftUI**: Modern, efficient, and clean codebase leveraging Swift and SwiftUI for a smooth and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift & SwiftUI**: The entire app is built using Swift and SwiftUI, ensuring a native and seamless user experience.
- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for:
  - **Authentication**: User sign-up, login, and secure authentication.
  - **Database**: Real-time database to store and retrieve user data, such as progress, scores, and preferences.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/onyx-code.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
